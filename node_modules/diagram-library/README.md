#### React support

It renders a [Diagram](https://www.mindfusion.eu/onlinehelp/jsdiagram/index.htm?CC_T_MindFusion_Diagramming_Diagram_0.htm) instance assigned to "diagram" prop as its model. Most diagram properties can be set from JSX, and all diagram events can be handled through JSX syntax as well. For more information, see the [Integration with React](https://www.mindfusion.eu/onlinehelp/jsdiagram/index.htm?React.htm) topic.
